# BorderlandGame
A Java-based simulation of a competitive “Borderland” survival game, where characters with distinct stats (mental, physical), dynamic behaviors (Rational, Aggressive, Cautious, Unstable via the Strategy pattern), and trust-driven relationships face off in randomly selected mental or physical challenges to collect a full deck of cards and escape. It features a state machine for behavior transitions, a simple per-player trust model with decay/boost/betrayal mechanics, file-driven setup, and a clear separation of concerns (GameMaster, Arena, BorderlandManager). The project is fully documented with UML class, sequence and state diagrams, and comes with comprehensive JUnit 4 tests covering core logic (game play, fear updates, card trading, behavior decisions, and end-game conditions). It’s an excellent showcase of object-oriented design, the Strategy pattern, and test-driven development.
